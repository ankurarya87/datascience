Title : Where_to_live_in_New_York_City 

A data-based approach is used to search best place to live in New York City (NYC). The search is 
done by using real and recent data obtained from NYC Open Data, Zillow, Google and Foursquare. 
Types of data include residential property prices, crime reported to NYPD, real traffic-based 
commute time, restaurant cuisines, shopping complexes, parks and education institutions.                                

A detail report is very informative - Where_to_Live_in_New_York_City.pdf
